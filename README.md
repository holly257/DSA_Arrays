# Working With Arrays

1. Implement an Array class from scratch.
2. Explore the push() method
    * What is the length, capacity, and memory address of your array?
        * 
    * Add the following and then print the array:
        * arr.push(5);
        * arr.push(15);
        * arr.push(19);
        * arr.push(45);
        * arr.push(10);
    * What is the length, capacity and memory address of your array? 
    * Explain the result of your program after adding the new lines of code.
